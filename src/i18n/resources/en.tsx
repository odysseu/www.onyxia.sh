    "what is onyxia body": `Onyxia enables data scientists to work with modern cloud based technologies even 
            if they are not well versed into computing.  
            At its core Onyxia is a web UI that turns a helm chart repo into a catalog of services.
            Onyxia enables to provide your data scientists with a nice and intuitive interface for launching [containers](https://wwww.docker.com/) like [Spark, RStudio or Jupyter](https://datalab/sppcloud.fr/catalog).  
            On top of that Onyxia features a tight S3 integration via [MinIO](https://min.io/) or [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).`,
